I developed a simple game using Pygame Zero, a Python library for creating games. The game involves clicking on a moving apple sprite within a defined window area to score points and advance levels. Features include dynamic scoring, level progression, and increasing difficulty as the game progresses. Implemented functionalities include random apple placement, score tracking, level management, and event handling for mouse clicks. This project demonstrates proficiency in Python programming, game development concepts, and problem-solving skills.
